## Problem Statement
Every year millions of people travel to coastal areas all over the world to experience and enjoy the ocean. One of the best and easiest ways to do so is to go snorkeling. However, since many who enter the ocean and explore the reefs and other ecosystems are not educated on how to explore these areas, they risk damaging habitats out of negligence. Whether it's a group of tourists who head to a beach and leave trash or a group of snorkelers who walk all over the coral, causing it to die, it all has a negative impact on the lifespan of these beautiful natural environments. We believe that this issue stems from a lack of education on how to snorkel safely and sustainably, and that this lack of education stems from a lack of easily accessible resources for tourists. There seems to be a “barrier to entry” when it comes to aquatic activities, such as needing to do a lot of research and expensive gear. These issues are very easy to fix and cause major damage to the ecosystems they affect, so by helping others understand what they should do and how to interact with wildlife, as well as connecting them to local eco-friendly snorkeling tours, we can better protect the oceans.

Our solution will help combat this by creating a digital tool that educates and assists users by organizing snorkeling locations, equipment, safety, and skills. We hypothesize that consolidating this information will help reduce the barrier to entry for recreational aquatic exploration. Ultimately, this resource will help users quickly answer the following questions:
1. Where can I snorkel?
1. What equipment do I need to snorkel?
1. How do I snorkel in a way that protects me and the environment?

## Features

### Location-based search
Users will be able to search for snorkeling locations through a simple query. The website will return a list of locations that match the query parameters.

### Location listings
Location listings will incorporate local weather data in a card format to give users a high-level overview of a snorkeling location. Weather data will include current temperature, precipitation, wind speed, wave height, high tide time, and low tide time. Location data will also include the location name and address.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
